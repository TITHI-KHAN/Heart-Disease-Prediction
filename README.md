# Heart-Disease-Prediction

**Annual CDC survey data of 400k adults related to their health status:**

The original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 18 variables. In addition to classical EDA, this dataset can be used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, XgBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ANN etc.). You should treat the variable "HeartDisease" as a binary ("Yes" - respondent had heart disease; "No" - respondent had no heart disease). But note that classes are not balanced, So the classic model application approach is not advisable. Fixing the weights/undersampling should yield significantly betters results. Based on the dataset, Can you indicate which variables have a significant effect on the likelihood of heart disease? Do analysis.

The dataset contains 18 variables (9 booleans, 5 strings and 4 decimals). In machine learning projects, "HeartDisease" can be used as the explonatory variable, but note that the classes are heavily unbalanced.

1. **HeartDisease**: Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI)

2. **BMI**: Body Mass Index (BMI)
